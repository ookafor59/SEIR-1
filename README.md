# SEIR-1
Systems Engineering & Identity Responsibility (SEIR-I)

A 2-Year Applied Program in Cloud Infrastructure, Identity, and Federated Trust

Infrastructure decides what can exist.
Identity decides who is trusted.
This program teaches both — responsibly.

2️⃣ Program Length

24 months (2 years)
    Designed as an apprenticeship-style program, not a sprint.
    Identity systems take time to understand because mistakes are irreversible.

Systems Engineering & Identity Responsibility (SEIR-I) is a two-year applied program focused on how identity, access, and trust are designed and operated in modern cloud environments. While many programs treat identity as a configuration detail, this program treats identity as a primary system of responsibility. Students learn how access is granted, extended, audited, and recovered across cloud platforms.

This program uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as the primary infrastructure environment, with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) as the identity authority. Students learn how identity is extended from Microsoft into GCP using federation, SSO, and modern authentication protocols. The emphasis is not on setup alone, but on understanding failure modes, blast radius, and recovery.

Students are trained to work with identity systems carefully and deliberately. Identity changes are slow by design, difficult to reverse, and often high impact. This program teaches how to reason about identity decisions before they are made, how to verify trust relationships, and how to debug access failures using evidence rather than guesswork.

Automation plays a central role. Students use PowerShell and infrastructure-as-code to manage identity and access at scale. They learn how to automate safely, how to log identity events, and how to produce audit-ready artifacts. AI tools are introduced as bounded assistants for analysis and summarization, never as decision makers.

SEIR-I is designed for students who want to be trusted with systems that control access to people, data, and infrastructure. A college degree is not required. What matters is patience, consistency, and respect for responsibility. This program is not fast, not easy, and not casual — it is real.

3️⃣ Summary of Skills to Be Learned
This program focuses on who is allowed to do what, where, and why — across clouds.

Core Cloud & Infrastructure Skills
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure design
    Networking, compute, and platform services in GCP
    Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform
    CI/CD and automation pipelines
    Evidence-based debugging and operational reasoning

Identity & Access Management (Primary Focus)
    Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory) architecture
    (Microsoft Azure Active Directory)
    Identity lifecycle management
    Extending identity from Microsoft to Google Cloud
    (Google Cloud Platform)
    Federation using SAML, OAuth, and OpenID Connect
    Single Sign-On (SSO) design and enforcement
    Cross-cloud trust boundaries
    Least privilege and blast-radius control

Automation & Tooling
    PowerShell for identity and infrastructure automation
    Secure scripting practices
    Change control for identity systems
    Logging and audit artifacts for identity events

AI (Used Correctly)
    Using AI (OpenAI) and Vertex as a bounded assistant
    AI for analysis and summarization, not authority
    Human-in-the-loop enforcement for identity decisions

4️⃣ Relevance to the Job Market

Identity is no longer a side skill.
It is the control plane of modern systems.
This program prepares students for roles where trust, access, and failure matter.

Relevant Job Roles
    Identity & Access Management (IAM) Engineer
    Cloud Identity Engineer
    Platform Engineer (Identity-focused)
    Security Engineer (IAM / Federation)
    Enterprise Systems Engineer
    Cloud Infrastructure Engineer with IAM ownership

Why This Skill Set Is in Demand
    Multi-cloud environments are now normal
    Identity failures cause the most expensive incidents
    Federation mistakes are hard to reverse
    Companies need engineers who understand trust, not just tools                    

Graduates are trained to:
    design identity systems that scale
    debug access failures without panic
    explain identity risk to non-technical leadership
    operate under audit and compliance pressure
    
These skills are rare and increasingly well-paid.

5️⃣ Description of Challenge Labs
Engineered Difficulty for Identity Systems
    Identity labs are not demos.
    They are controlled encounters with risk.

Challenge Lab Examples
“The Lockout Lab”
    Automation succeeds.
    Access fails.
    Students must recover identity access without breaking trust boundaries.

Teaches:
    Recovery discipline
    Why identity changes must be slow and deliberate

“Federation That Worked Yesterday”
    SSO breaks after a seemingly unrelated change.
    Students must prove where trust failed across clouds.

Teaches:
    Federation fragility
    Evidence-based debugging
    Cross-team communication

“Blast Radius of Identity”
A permissions change works as intended — and exposes too much.

Teaches:
    Least privilege
    Why identity errors are more dangerous than infrastructure errors

“AI Was Confident — and Wrong”
    AI summarizes identity risk incorrectly.
    Logs and audit trails disagree.

Teaches:
    Human accountability
    Evidence over confidence
    Guardrails for AI use


Midpoint Identity Suffering Week
A structured sequence of identity failures:
    access denial
    federation breakage
    conditional access conflicts

With built-in recovery and reflection.

Teaches:
    Calm under pressure
    Respect for identity systems
    Professional judgment

Optional: Relevant Certifications (Not Required, Not the Goal)
Certifications are supporting tools, not outcomes.
Students may optionally pursue:
    Microsoft SC-300 (Identity and Access Administrator)
    Microsoft AZ-104 (Azure Administrator)
    Google Professional Cloud Security Engineer
    Google Professional Cloud Architect

These certifications align naturally with the curriculum but are not substitutes for judgment.
