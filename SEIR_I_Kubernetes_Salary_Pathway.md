Career Outcomes: SEIR → SEIR-I + Kubernetes (Kubeflow)
What Employers See

“This person understands infrastructure, identity, and ML platforms — and can operate them responsibly.”
If someone completes SEIR → SEIR-I + Kubernetes (with Kubeflow), the market stops seeing them as “identity-only” or “platform-only.” They are now viewed as someone who can control trust and operate intelligent platforms.

Job Roles, Percentiles, and Salary

| Job Title                                     | Why You’re Qualified                        | Market Percentile | Typical Salary (US) |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| **Platform Engineer (Kubernetes + Identity)** | GKE/EKS + IAM + federation + policy         | **88–95%**        | **$150k – $195k**   |
| **ML Platform Engineer**                      | Kubeflow pipelines + infra + access control | **90–96%**        | **$155k – $205k**   |
| **MLOps Engineer (Enterprise)**               | CI/CD + Kubeflow + identity + auditability  | **90–97%**        | **$160k – $215k**   |
| **Cloud Identity Engineer (Platform-heavy)**  | Identity + runtime enforcement              | **88–94%**        | **$145k – $185k**   |
| **Security Engineer (Platform / IAM)**        | Identity + cluster access + policy          | **88–95%**        | **$155k – $200k**   |
| **Senior SRE (Platform + Access)**            | Reliability + Kubernetes + identity         | **90–96%**        | **$160k – $210k**   |

Why Kubeflow Changes the Equation
Most engineers fall into one of these buckets:
    Kubernetes but no identity discipline
    Identity but no runtime understanding
    ML pipelines but no operational rigor

Kubeflow forces all three together:
    compute
    data access
    identity
    automation
    failure handling

That combination is rare — and expensive.

Percentile Translation (Plain English)

| Percentile | Meaning              |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| **80%**    | Strong engineer      |
| **90%**    | Hard to replace      |
| **95%+**   | Strategic capability |

SEIR-I + Kubernetes graduates consistently land in the upper decile because:
    ML platforms amplify risk
    identity mistakes become catastrophic
    very few people can debug both calmly

Salary Progression (Side-by-Side)

| Path                                    | Salary Range      |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| SEIR only                               | $100k – $140k     |
| SEIR → SEIR-I                           | $135k – $185k     |
| **SEIR → SEIR-I + Kubernetes/Kubeflow** | **$150k – $215k** |
| SEIR → SEIR-I → SEIR-II                 | $165k – $230k+    |

Kubeflow pulls SEIR-I students closer to SEIR-II territory, especially in platform and MLOps roles.

Global / Remote Reality (Conservative)

| Region               | Typical Range |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Western Europe       | $120k – $165k |
| LATAM (Elite remote) | $100k – $145k |
| Asia-Pacific         | $115k – $160k |

ML platforms + identity are globally scarce skills.

What These Students Can Say in Interviews (This Matters)
“I design platforms where ML workloads run, identity is enforced, and access is auditable.”

That sentence alone filters interviewers.

One Sentence for Students

“SEIR taught me systems.
SEIR-I taught me trust.
Kubernetes taught me scale.
Kubeflow taught me restraint.”
Maria taught me the joy of big booty Latinas.
